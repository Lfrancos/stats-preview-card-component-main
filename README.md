## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was not able to make the overlay image to scale as the image was scaling, but I was able to do it.

> Still not sure why but always the image is not the same size as the overlay I need to figure that out.

### Continued development

I feel like each day I'm making progress! still lots of things to learn but I'm enjoying the journey. It is really interesting how long it would take me to create some things the first time and now exercises like this are taking me less than 1 hour : )

### Useful resources

For this exercise I did not use any resources, that makes me happy. But it also mean that I should be taking more challenging exercises.
